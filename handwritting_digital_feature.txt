Database:
1. MNIST
Class Number: 10
Sample number: Training set( 60000), Test set (10000)
image size: 28 x 28

2. USPS
Class number: 10
Sample number: Training set (7291), Test set (2007)
image size: 16 x 16

3. SVHN
Class number: 10
Sample number: Training set (73257)  valid set ( 26032) test (531131)


Task:
1. VGG16 feature maps
(1)To fine-tune the vgg16 with 60000 training samples from MNIST, then
extract the convolutional activations from the CONV5_3 layer of
vgg16 for  all the 60000+10000 MNIST samples, all the 7291+2007 USPS
samples, and the 73257 + 26032 SVHN samples.
(2) The feaures with their labels are saved as *.mat files.


2. ResNet feature maps
(1) To fine-tune the ResNet (the number of layers is determined by
you) with 60000 training samples from MNIST, then extract the
convolutional activations from the conv5_x layer of the netowrk for all the 60000+10000 MNIST samples, all the  7291+2007 USPS samples, and the 73257 + 26032 SVHN samples.
(2) The feaures with their labels are saved as *.mat files.


I will appreciate that the feature of MNIST and USPS dataset can be
obtained before 11/8/2018. The other features are obtained before
11/10/2018.
